# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
make preview          # Serve locally at localhost:4000 (with live reload)
make all              # Build to _site/
make install          # Install gem dependencies (gems go to vendor/bundle; no sudo)

bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''   # Manual serve equivalent
bundle exec jekyll build                # Manual build equivalent
```

**macOS — use Homebrew Ruby (not system Ruby 2.6).** This project’s `Gemfile.lock` needs **Ruby 3.2+** and **Bundler 2.7.x**. Apple’s system Ruby is **2.6**, so `bundler 2.7.2` cannot install there (“requires Ruby version >= 3.2.0”).

1. Install Ruby and put it first on your `PATH`:

   ```bash
   brew install ruby
   ```

   Then add **one** of these to `~/.zshrc` (restart the terminal after):

   - **Apple Silicon:** `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"`
   - **Intel Mac:** `export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"`

   Confirm: `which ruby` should **not** be `/usr/bin/ruby`, and `ruby -v` should show **3.2+**.

2. Install Bundler and project gems:

   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   cd /path/to/athxrva02.github.io
   make install
   ```

Gems install into **`vendor/bundle`** (see `.bundle/config`), so no `sudo` is needed.

Deployment is automatic via GitHub Pages on push to `master`. No manual deploy step needed.

## Architecture

This is a **Jekyll 4.4** academic personal website. It uses a single layout (`_layouts/default.html`) for all pages. Frontend uses Bootstrap 5.3.3 and Font Awesome 7.0.1 via CDN. All custom styles are in `css/theme.css`.

### Pages

| Page | File | Nav link |
|------|------|----------|
| Home (bio, awards) | `index.md` | brand link |
| People | `people/index.md` | ✅ |
| Publications | `publications/index.md` | ✅ |
| Teaching | `teaching/index.md` | ✅ |
| Service | `service/index.md` | ✅ |
| Bio / Timeline | `bio/index.md` | — (linked from home) |

Legacy pages (no nav entry): `theses/`, `jobs/`, `recipes/`.

### Data-driven content

The main content areas are driven entirely by YAML data files — no content changes require editing HTML or Liquid templates:

- `_data/publications.yml` — all papers, grouped by year, rendered on `/publications/`
- `_data/selected_publications.yml` — curated papers shown as cards on `/publications/`; references entries by `id` from the full list
- `_data/supervision.yml` — three arrays: `phd_students`, `postdocs`, `masters`; rendered on `/people/`
- `_data/teaching.yml` — institutions with nested course arrays, rendered on `/teaching/`
- `_data/service.yml` — `intro`, `chairs`, and `pc_member` arrays; rendered on `/service/`
- `_data/awards.yml` — awards and grants shown on the home page; each entry has `name` and `type` (`award` or `grant`)
- `_data/timeline.yml` — career timeline entries rendered on `/bio/`; each entry has `year`, `icon`, `title`, `org`, optional `detail` and `current`

**Convention: no HTML in `_data/` files.** All fields must be plain text. Presentation (icons, links, badges) is handled exclusively in templates and includes. For structured links (e.g. a collaborator), use separate `_name` / `_link` fields and let the template render the anchor tag.

```

### Includes

- `_includes/pub-highlight.html` — publication card (venue badge + title + authors + links)
- `_includes/student-card.html` — single person card
- `_includes/people-list.html` — wraps multiple student cards in a flex grid

### Navigation active state

The navbar underlines the active section by comparing `page.url` against each nav link in `_layouts/default.html`. When adding a new top-level section, add both the page and a nav entry there.
